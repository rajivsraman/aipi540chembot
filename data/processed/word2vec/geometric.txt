stereoisomerism geometric isomerism geometric isomerism also known a isomerism or isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism
this page explains what stereoisomers are and how you recognise the possibility of geometric isomer in a molecule
further down the page you will find a link to a second page which describes the notation for naming geometric isomer
you should move on to that page even if the notation is what your syllabus is asking for until you are really confident about how geometric isomer arise and how they are named on the system
the system is better for naming more complicated structure but is more difficult to understand than
the system of naming is still widely used especially for the sort of simple molecule you will meet at this level
that mean that irrespective of what your syllabus might say you will have to be familiar with both system
get the easier one sorted out before you go on to the more sophisticated one
what is stereoisomerism
what are isomer
isomer are molecule that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of the atom in space
that excludes any different arrangement which are simply due to the molecule rotating a a whole or rotating about particular bond
where the atom making up the various isomer are joined up in a different order this is known a structural isomerism
structural isomerism is not a form of stereoisomerism and is dealt with on a separate page
what are stereoisomers
in stereoisomerism the atom making up the isomer are joined up in the same order but still manage to have a different spatial arrangement
geometric isomerism is one form of stereoisomerism
geometric ci trans isomerism how geometric isomer arise these isomer occur where you have restricted rotation somewhere in a molecule
at an introductory level in organic chemistry example usually just involve the double bond and that what this page will concentrate on
think about what happens in molecule where there is unrestricted rotation about carbon bond in other word where the bond are all single
the next diagram show two possible configuration of
these two model represent exactly the same molecule
you can get from one to the other just by twisting around the single bond
these molecule are not isomer
if you draw a structural formula instead of using model you have to bear in mind the possibility of this free rotation about single bond
you must accept that these two structure represent the same molecule but what happens if you have a double bond a in
these two molecule are the same
the double bond wo rotate and so you would have to take the model to piece in order to convert one structure into the other one
that is a simple test for isomer
if you have to take a model to piece to convert it into another one then you got isomer
if you merely have to twist it a bit then you have

in reality the reason is that you would have to break the pi bond
pi bond are formed by the sideways overlap between p orbitals
if you tried to rotate the bond the p orbitals wo line up any more and so the pi bond is disrupted
this cost energy and only happens if the compound is heated strongly

be warned though that you might have to read several page of background material and it could all take a long time
it is necessary for understanding the rest of this page
drawing structural formula for the last pair of model give two possible isomer
in one the two chlorine atom are locked on opposite side of the double bond
this is known a the trans isomer
trans from latin meaning across a in transatlantic
in the other the two chlorine atom are locked on the same side of the double bond
this is know a the ci isomer
ci from latin meaning on this side the most likely example of geometric isomerism you will meet at an introductory level is
in one case the ch3 group are on opposite side of the double bond and in the other case they are on the same side
geometric isomerism in cyclic compound geometric isomer can only occur where there is restricted rotation about a bond
so far we have looked at the simplest example of this where there is a double bond between two carbon atom but there are other possibility a well
if you have a ring of carbon atom there will also be no possibility of rotation about any of the bond
cyclohexane is a simple example now suppose you replaced two of the hydrogen in the cyclohexane molecule by two bromine atom the shape around each carbon atom is tetrahedral and there are two different way the bromine atom can arrange themselves
they can both lie above the ring or one can be above the ring and the other below
the next diagram is taken from pubchem and show the molecule where one bromine is above and the other below the ring
this would be a trans form
if you swapped the hydrogen and bromine atom around on one of the carbon atom then both bromine would be on the same side a ci form
pubchem you will find that this diagram can be rotated in space so that you can see it more clearly
you will find it in the section titled 3d conformer
the importance of drawing geometric isomer properly it very easy to miss geometric isomer in exam if you take in drawing the structural formula
for example it is very tempting to draw a if you write it like this you will almost certainly miss the fact that there are geometric isomer
if there is even the slightest hint in a question that isomer might be involved always draw compound containing double bond showing the correct bond angle around the carbon atom at the end of the bond
in other word use the format shown in the last diagram above
how to recognise the possibility of geometric isomerism you obviously need to have restricted rotation somewhere in the molecule
compound containing a double bond have this restricted rotation
a we have seen other sort of compound may have restricted rotation a well but we are concentrating on the case you are most likely to meet when you first come across geometric isomer
if you have a double bond you need to think carefully about the possibility of geometric isomer
what need to be attached to the double bond
if your school or college ha given you the opportunity to play around with molecular model in the early stage of your organic chemistry course you might consider getting hold of a cheap set
the model made by molymod are both cheap and easy to use
an introductory organic set is more than adequate
google molymod to find a supplier and more about them or have a look at this set or this set or something similar from amazon
share the cost with some friend keep it in good condition and do lose any bit and resell it via ebay or amazon at the end of your course
alternatively get hold of some coloured plasticene or other child modelling clay and some used match and make your own
it cheaper but more difficult to get the bond angle right
think about this case although we swapped the group around these are still the same molecule
to get from one to the other all you would have to do is to turn the whole model over
you wo have geometric isomer if there are two group the same on one end of the bond in this case the two pink group on the end
so
there must be two different group on the carbon and two different group on the one
the case we been exploring earlier are like this but you could make thing even more different and still have geometric isomer here the blue and green group are either on the same side of the bond or the opposite side
or you could go the whole hog and make everything different
you still get geometric isomer but by now the word ci and trans are meaningless
this is where the more sophisticated notation come in
summary to get geometric isomer you must have restricted rotation often involving a double bond for introductory purpose two different group on the end of the bond and two different group on the end
it doe matter whether the group are the same a the one or not
if you are meeting geometric isomerism for the first time you may not need this at the moment
if you need to know about notation you could follow this link at once to the next page
but be sure that you understand what you have already read on this page first
alternatively read to the bottom of this page where you will find this link repeated
the effect of geometric isomerism on physical property the table show the melting point and boiling point of the ci and trans isomer of
in each case the higher melting or boiling point is shown in red
you will notice that the trans isomer ha the higher melting point the ci isomer ha the higher boiling point
this is common
you can see the same effect with the ci and trans isomer of why is the boiling point of the ci isomer higher
there must be stronger intermolecular force between the molecule of the ci isomer than between trans isomer
taking a an example both of the isomer have exactly the same atom joined up in exactly the same order
that mean that the van der waals dispersion force between the molecule will be identical in both case
the difference between the two is that the ci isomer is a polar molecule whereas the trans isomer is
you need to know about van der waals dispersion force and interaction and to follow the link on that page to another about bond polarity if you need to
on your browser to return to this page
both molecule contain polar bond but in the ci isomer they are both on the same side of the molecule
that mean that one side of the molecule will have a slight negative charge while the other is slightly positive
the molecule is therefore polar
because of this there will be interaction a well a dispersion force needing extra energy to break
that will raise the boiling point
a similar thing happens where there are ch3 group attached to the double bond a in
alkyl group like methyl group tend to push electron away from themselves
you again get a polar molecule although with a reversed polarity from the first example
the alkyl group doe literally push the electron away the other end of the bond attracts them more strongly
the arrow with the cross on representing the more positive end of the bond are a conventional way of showing this electron pushing effect
by contrast although there will still be polar bond in the trans isomer overall the molecule are
the slight charge on the top of the molecule a drawn is exactly balanced by an equivalent charge on the bottom
the slight charge on the left of the molecule is exactly balanced by the same charge on the right
this lack of overall polarity mean that the only intermolecular attraction these molecule experience are van der waals dispersion force
less energy is needed to separate them and so their boiling point are lower
why is the melting point of the ci isomer lower
you might have thought that the same argument would lead to a higher melting point for ci isomer a well but there is another important factor operating
in order for the intermolecular force to work well the molecule must be able to pack together efficiently in the solid
trans isomer pack better than ci isomer
the u shape of the ci isomer doe pack a well a the straighter shape of the trans isomer
the poorer packing in the ci isomer mean that the intermolecular force are a effective a they should be and so less energy is needed to melt the molecule a lower melting point
