reaction of aldehyde and ketone with grignard reagent this page look at the reaction of aldehyde and ketone with grignard reagent to produce potentially quite complicated alcohol
it is mainly a duplication of the information on these same reaction from a page on grignard reagent in the section on property of halogenoalkanes

what are grignard reagent
a grignard reagent ha a formula rmgx where x is a halogen and r is an alkyl or aryl based on a benzene ring group
for the purpose of this page we shall take r to be an alkyl group
a typical grignard reagent might be ch3ch2mgbr
the preparation of a grignard reagent grignard reagent are made by adding the halogenoalkane to small bit of magnesium in a flask containing ethoxyethane commonly called diethyl ether or just ether
the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and the mixture is warmed over a water bath for 20 30 minute
everything must be perfectly dry because grignard reagent react with water
ethoxyethane ether is very dangerous to work with
it is an anaesthetic and is extremely inflammable
under no circumstance should you try to carry out this reaction without properly qualified guidance
any reaction using the grignard reagent are carried out with the mixture produced from this reaction
you ca separate it out in any way
reaction of grignard reagent with aldehyde and ketone these are reaction of the double bond and so aldehyde and ketone react in exactly the same way all that change are the group that happen to be attached to the double bond
it is much easier to understand what is going on by looking closely at the general case using r group rather than specific group and then slotting in the various real group a and when you need to
the r group can be either hydrogen or alkyl in any combination
in the first stage the grignard reagent add across the double bond dilute acid is then added to this to hydrolyse it
mg oh br a the other product of the reaction
that actually misleading because these compound react with dilute acid
what you end up with would be a mixture of ordinary hydrated magnesium ion halide ion and sulphate or chloride ion depending on which dilute acid you added
what you need to learn about this depends on what your examiner want
the only way to find that out is to look at old exam paper and mark scheme

an alcohol is formed
one of the key us of grignard reagent is the ability to make complicated alcohol easily
what sort of alcohol you get depends on the carbonyl compound you started with in other word what r and r are
the reaction between grignard reagent and methanal in methanal both r group are hydrogen
methanal is the simplest possible aldehyde
assuming that you are starting with ch3ch2mgbr and using the general equation above the alcohol you get always ha the form since both r group are hydrogen atom the final product will be a primary alcohol is formed
a primary alcohol ha only one alkyl group attached to the carbon atom with the group on it
you could obviously get a different primary alcohol if you started from a different grignard reagent
the reaction between grignard reagent and other aldehyde the next biggest aldehyde is ethanal
one of the r group is hydrogen and the other ch3
again think about how that relates to the general case
the alcohol formed is so this time the final product ha one ch3 group and one hydrogen attached a secondary alcohol ha two alkyl group the same or different attached to the carbon with the group on it
you could change the nature of the final secondary alcohol by either changing the nature of the grignard reagent which would change the ch3ch2 group into some other alkyl group changing the nature of the aldehyde which would change the ch3 group into some other alkyl group
the reaction between grignard reagent and ketone ketone have two alkyl group attached to the double bond
the simplest one is propanone
this time when you replace the r group in the general formula for the alcohol produced you get a tertiary alcohol
a tertiary alcohol ha three alkyl group attached to the carbon with the attached
the alkyl group can be any combination of same or different
you could ring the change on the product by changing the nature of the grignard reagent which would change the ch3ch2 group into some other alkyl group changing the nature of the ketone which would change the ch3 group into whatever other alkyl group you choose to have in the original ketone
