alkene and sulphuric acid this page look at the reaction of the double bond in alkene such a ethene with concentrated sulphuric acid
it includes the conversion of the product into an alcohol
the addition of sulphuric acid to alkene the reaction with ethene alkene react with concentrated sulphuric acid in the cold to produce alkyl hydrogensulphates
ethene reacts to give ethyl hydrogensulphate
the structure of the product molecule is sometimes written a ch3ch2hso4 but the version in the equation is better because it show how all the atom are linked up
you may also find it written a ch3ch2oso3h
confused by all this
do be
all you need to do is to learn the structure of sulphuric acid
a hydrogen from the sulphuric acid join on to one of the carbon atom and the rest join on to the other one
make sure that you can see how the structure of the sulphuric acid relates to the various way of writing the formula for the product
important
learn this structure for sulphuric acid
sketch it over and over again until you ca possibly get it wrong

the reaction with propene this is typical of the reaction with unsymmetrical alkene
an unsymmetrical alkene ha different group at either end of the double bond
if sulphuric acid add to an unsymmetrical alkene like propene there are two possible way it could add
you could end up with one of two product depending on which carbon atom the hydrogen attache itself to
however in practice there is only one major product
this is in line with markovnikov rule which say when a compound hx is added to an unsymmetrical alkene the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the most hydrogen attached to it already
in this case the hydrogen becomes attached to the ch2 group because the ch2 group ha more hydrogen than the ch group
notice that only the hydrogen directly attached to the carbon atom at either end of the double bond count
the one in the ch3 group are totally irrelevant
markovnikov rule is a useful guide for you to work out which way round to add something across a double bond but it is the reason why thing add that way
a a general principle do quote markovnikov rule in an exam unless you are specifically asked for it
you can find more about this in the mechanism section of this site

using these reaction to make alcohol making ethanol ethene is passed into concentrated sulphuric acid to make ethyl hydrogensulphate a above
the product is diluted with water and then distilled
the water reacts with the ethyl hydrogensulphate to produce ethanol which distils off
making more complicated alkyl hydrogensulphates react with water in exactly the same way
for example notice that the position of the group is determined by where the hso4 group wa attached
you get rather than because of the way the sulphuric acid originally added across the double bond in propene
using these reaction these reaction were originally used a a way of manufacturing alcohol from alkene in the petrochemical industry
these day alcohol like ethanol or tend to be manufactured by direct hydration of the alkene because it is cheaper and easier
