replacing the group in alcohol by a halogen this page look at reaction in which the group in an alcohol is replaced by a halogen such a chlorine or bromine
it includes a simple test for an group using phosphorus v chloride
reaction involving hydrogen halide the general reaction look like this reaction with hydrogen chloride tertiary alcohol react reasonably rapidly with concentrated hydrochloric acid but for primary or secondary alcohol the reaction rate are too slow for the reaction to be of much importance
a tertiary alcohol reacts if it is shaken with concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature
a tertiary halogenoalkane haloalkane or alkyl halide is formed the term primary secondary and tertiary are used in exactly the same way with halogenoalkanes

replacing by bromine rather than using hydrobromic acid you usually treat the alcohol with a mixture of sodium or potassium bromide and concentrated sulphuric acid
this produce hydrogen bromide which reacts with the alcohol
the mixture is warmed to distil off the bromoalkane
you do need to read the beginning of that page because it is just a modification of this one

replacing by iodine in this case the alcohol is reacted with a mixture of sodium or potassium iodide and concentrated phosphoric v acid h3po4 and the iodoalkane is distilled off
the mixture of the iodide and phosphoric v acid produce hydrogen iodide which reacts with the alcohol
phosphoric v acid is used instead of concentrated sulphuric acid because sulphuric acid oxidises iodide ion to iodine and produce hardly any hydrogen iodide
a similar thing happens to some extent with bromide ion in the preparation of bromoalkanes but not enough to get in the way of the main reaction
there is no reason why you could use phosphoric v acid in the bromide case instead of sulphuric acid if you wanted to
in the present context all you would need to do is read the beginning of that page

reacting alcohol with phosphorus halide reaction with phosphorus iii chloride pcl3 alcohol react with liquid phosphorus iii chloride also called phosphorus trichloride to make chloroalkanes
reaction with phosphorus v chloride pcl5 solid phosphorus v chloride phosphorus pentachloride reacts violently with alcohol at room temperature producing cloud of hydrogen chloride gas
it is a good choice a a way of making chloroalkanes although it is used a a test for group in organic chemistry
to show that a substance wa an alcohol you would first have to eliminate all the other thing which also react with phosphorus v chloride
for example carboxylic acid containing the group react with it because of the in and so doe water
if you have a neutral liquid not contaminated with water and get a violent reaction producing cloud of steamy fume of hydrogen chloride when you add phosphorus v chloride then you have an alcohol group present
there are also side reaction involving the pocl3 reacting with the alcohol
other reaction involving phosphorus halide instead of using phosphorus iii bromide or iodide the alcohol is usually heated under reflux with a mixture of red phosphorus and either bromine or iodine
the phosphorus first reacts with the bromine or iodine to give the phosphorus iii halide
these then react with the alcohol to give the corresponding halogenoalkane which can be distilled off
reacting alcohol with sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride the reaction sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride ha the formula socl2
traditionally the formula is written a shown despite the fact that the modern name writes the chlorine before the oxygen alphabetical order
the sulphur dichloride oxide reacts with alcohol at room temperature to produce a chloroalkane
sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are given off
care would have to be taken because both of these are poisonous
why this reaction is useful the big advantage that this reaction ha over the use of either of the phosphorus chloride is that the two other product of the reaction sulphur dioxide and hcl are both gas
that mean that they separate themselves from the reaction mixture
