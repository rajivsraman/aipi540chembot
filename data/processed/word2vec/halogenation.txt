the halogenation of benzene this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and chlorine or bromine in the presence of a catalyst such a aluminium chloride or iron
if you want this mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact benzene reacts with chlorine or bromine in an electrophilic substitution reaction but only in the presence of a catalyst
the catalyst is either aluminium chloride or aluminium bromide if you are reacting benzene with bromine or iron
strictly speaking iron is a catalyst because it get permanently changed during the reaction
it reacts with some of the chlorine or bromine to form iron iii chloride fecl3 or iron iii bromide febr3
these compound act a the catalyst and behave exactly like aluminium chloride in these reaction
the reaction with chlorine the reaction between benzene and chlorine in the presence of either aluminium chloride or iron give chlorobenzene
or the reaction with bromine the reaction between benzene and bromine in the presence of either aluminium bromide or iron give bromobenzene
iron is usually used because it is cheaper and more readily available
or the formation of the electrophile we are going to explore the reaction using chlorine and aluminium chloride
if you want one of the other combination all you have to do is to replace each cl by br or each al by fe
a a chlorine molecule approach the benzene ring the delocalised electron in the ring repel electron in the bond
it is the slightly positive end of the chlorine molecule which act a the electrophile
the presence of the aluminium chloride help this polarisation
the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two the hydrogen is removed by the ion which wa formed in the first stage
the aluminium chloride catalyst is in this second stage
these compound act a the catalyst and behave exactly like aluminium chloride in these reaction
the reaction with chlorine the reaction between benzene and chlorine in the presence of either aluminium chloride or iron give chlorobenzene
