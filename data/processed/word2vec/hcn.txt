the nucleophilic addition of hydrogen cyanide to aldehyde and ketone this page give you the fact and simple uncluttered mechanism for the nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl compound specifically aldehyde and ketone and hydrogen cyanide hcn
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
aldehyde and ketone behave identically in their reaction with hydrogen cyanide and so will be considered together although equation and mechanism will be given for both type of compound for the sake of completeness
the fact hydrogen cyanide add across the double bond in aldehyde and ketone to produce compound known a hydroxynitriles
for example with ethanal an aldehyde you get with propanone a ketone you get in both of the above example the longest carbon chain is 3 carbon hence the prop in both name
the carbon with the nitrogen attached is always counted a the number 1 carbon in the chain
the reaction is normally done using hydrogen cyanide itself because this is an extremely poisonous gas
instead the aldehyde or ketone is mixed with a solution of sodium or potassium cyanide in water to which a little sulphuric acid ha been added
the ph of the solution is adjusted to about 4 5 because this give the fastest reaction
the solution will contain hydrogen cyanide from the reaction between the sodium or potassium cyanide and the sulphuric acid but still contains some free cyanide ion
this is important for the mechanism
hcn
again the ph of the solution is adjusted to around ph 5 in other word the sodium hydroxide is not added to excess
the rate of the reaction fall if the ph is any higher
whichever set of reagent you use the reaction contains the same mixture of hydrogen cyanide and cyanide ion
the mechanism these are example of nucleophilic addition
the double bond is highly polar and the slightly positive carbon atom is attacked by the cyanide ion acting a a nucleophile
nucleophile a specie molecule or ion which attack a positive site in something else
nucleophiles are either fully negative ion or contain a fairly negative region somewhere in a molecule
all nucleophiles have at least one active lone pair of electron
when you write mechanism for reaction involving nucleophiles you must show that lone pair
the mechanism for the addition of hcn to propanone in the first stage there is a nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion on the slightly positive carbon atom
the negative ion formed then pick up a hydrogen ion from somewhere for example from a hydrogen cyanide molecule
the hydrogen ion could also come from the water or the ion present in the slightly acidic solution
you do need to remember all of these
one equation is perfectly adequate
it ha been rotated through
there is no reason why you ca do that if it make the appearance of the mechanism easier to follow
the mechanism for the addition of hcn to ethanal a before the reaction start with a nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion on the slightly positive carbon atom
it is completed by the addition of a hydrogen ion from for example a hydrogen cyanide molecule
the central carbon atom still ha the same four group attached but to make the mechanism easier to follow they are simply arranged differently
that not a problem we still talking about the same substance
optical isomerism in when is made in this last mechanism it occurs a a racemic mixture a mixture of two optical isomer
it is possible that you might be expected to explain how this arises
you need to refer to recent exam paper and mark scheme
if you have already got these you can obtain them from your exam board via link on the syllabus page
optical isomerism occurs in compound which have four different group attached to a single carbon atom
in this case the product molecule contains a ch3 a cn an h and an oh all attached to the central carbon atom
the reason for the formation of equal amount of two isomer lie in the way the ethanal get attacked
ethanal is a planar molecule and attack by a cyanide ion will either be from above the plane of the molecule or from below
there is an equal chance of either happening
attack from one side will lead to one of the two isomer and attack from the other side will lead to the other
follow the link below
all aldehyde will form a racemic mixture in this way
unsymmetrical ketone will a well
a ketone can be unsymmetrical in the sense that there is a different alkyl group either side of the carbonyl group
what matter is that the product molecule must have four different group attached to the carbon which wa originally part of the double bond
