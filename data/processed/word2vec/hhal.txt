alkene and hydrogen halide this page look at the reaction of the double bond in alkene such a ethene with hydrogen halide such a hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide
symmetrical alkene like ethene or are dealt with first
these are alkene where identical group are attached to each end of the double bond
the extra problem associated with unsymmetrical one like propene are covered in a separate section afterwards
addition to symmetrical alkene what happens
all alkene undergo addition reaction with the hydrogen halide
a hydrogen atom join to one of the carbon atom originally in the double bond and a halogen atom to the other
for example with ethene and hydrogen chloride you get chloroethane with you get what happens if you add the hydrogen to the carbon atom at the end of the double bond and the chlorine to the end
you would still have the same product
the chlorine would be on a carbon atom next to the end of the chain you would simply have drawn the molecule flipped over in space
that would be different of the alkene wa unsymmetrical that why we have to look at them separately
condition the alkene react with gaseous hydrogen halide at room temperature
if the alkene is also a gas you can simply mix the gas
if the alkene is a liquid you can bubble the hydrogen halide through the liquid
alkene will also react with concentrated solution of the gas in water
a solution of hydrogen chloride in water is of course hydrochloric acid
a solution of hydrogen bromide in water is hydrobromic acid and so on
there are however problem with this
the water will also get involved in the reaction and you end up with a mixture of product
the mechanism for this reaction is almost invariably given for the reaction involving the alkene and the simple molecule or or whatever
in the presence of water these molecule will already have reacted with the water to produce hydroxonium ion and halide ion
the mechanism will therefore be different involving an initial attack by a hydroxonium ion
avoid this problem by using the pure gaseous hydrogen halide

reaction rate variation of rate when you change the halogen reaction rate increase in the order hf hcl hbr hi
hydrogen fluoride reacts much more slowly than the other three and is normally ignored in talking about these reaction
when the hydrogen halide react with alkene the bond ha to be broken
the bond strength fall a you go from hf to hi and the bond is particularly strong
because it is difficult to break the bond between the hydrogen and the fluorine the addition of hf is bound to be slow
variation of rate when you change the alkene this applies to unsymmetrical alkene a well a to symmetrical one
for simplicity the example given below are all symmetrical but they do have to be
reaction rate increase a the alkene get more complicated in the sense of the number of alkyl group such a methyl group attached to the carbon atom at either end of the double bond
for example there are two way of looking at the reason for this both of which need you to know about the mechanism for the reaction
you should look at the addition of hydrogen halide to unsymmetrical alkene a well a symmetrical one

if you do need to know about the mechanism skip over the next bit
alkene react because the electron in the pi bond attract thing with any degree of positive charge
anything which increase the electron density around the double bond will help this
alkyl group have a tendency to push electron away from themselves towards the double bond
the more alkyl group you have the more negative the area around the double bond becomes
the more negatively charged that region becomes the more it will attract molecule like hydrogen chloride
you will find more about the electron pushing effect of alkyl group on a page about carbocations in the mechanism section of this site
that is also important reading if you are to understand the next bit

the more important reason though lie in the stability of the intermediate ion formed during the reaction
the three example given above produce these carbocations carbonium ion at the stage of the reaction the stability of the intermediate ion governs the activation energy for the reaction
a you go towards the more complicated alkene the activation energy for the reaction fall
that mean that the reaction become faster

addition to unsymmetrical alkene what happens
in term of reaction condition and the factor affecting the rate of the reaction there is no difference whatsoever between these alkene and the symmetrical one described above
the problem come with the orientation of the addition in other word which way around the hydrogen and the halogen add across the double bond
orientation of addition if hcl add to an unsymmetrical alkene like propene there are two possible way it could add
however in practice there is only one major product
this is in line with markovnikov rule which say when a compound hx is added to an unsymmetrical alkene the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the most hydrogen attached to it already
in this case the hydrogen becomes attached to the ch2 group because the ch2 group ha more hydrogen than the ch group
notice that only the hydrogen directly attached to the carbon atom at either end of the double bond count
the one in the ch3 group are totally irrelevant
markovnikov rule is a useful guide for you to work out which way round to add something across a double bond but it is the reason why thing add that way
a a general principle do quote markovnikov rule in an exam unless you are specifically asked for it
you will find the proper reason for this in a page about the addition of hydrogen halide to unsymmetrical alkene in the mechanism section of this site

a special problem with hydrogen bromide unlike the other hydrogen halide hydrogen bromide can add to a double bond either way around depending on the condition of the reaction
if the hydrogen bromide and alkene are entirely pure in this case the hydrogen bromide add on according to markovnikov rule
for example with propene you would get
that is exactly the same a the way the other hydrogen halide add
if the hydrogen bromide and alkene contain trace of organic peroxide oxygen from the air tends to react slowly with alkene to produce some organic peroxide and so you do necessarily have to add them separately
this is therefore the reaction that you will tend to get unless you take care to exclude all air from the system
in this case the addition is the other way around and you get this is sometimes described a an addition or a the peroxide effect
organic peroxide are excellent source of free radical
in the presence of these the hydrogen bromide reacts with alkene using a different faster mechanism
for various reason this doe happen with the other hydrogen halide
this reaction can also happen in this way in the presence of light of the right wavelength to break the bond into hydrogen and bromine free radical
