the hydrogenation of alkene this page look at the reaction of the double bond in alkene with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst
this is called hydrogenation
it includes the manufacture of margarine from animal or vegetable fat and oil
hydrogenation in the lab the hydrogenation of ethene ethene reacts with hydrogen in the presence of a finely divided nickel catalyst at a temperature of about
ethane is produced
this is a fairly pointless reaction because ethene is a far more useful compound than ethane
however what is true of the reaction of the double bond in ethene is equally true of it in much more complicated case
margarine manufacture some margarine is made by hydrogenating double bond in animal or vegetable fat and oil
you can recognise the presence of this in food because the ingredient list will include word showing that it contains hydrogenated vegetable oil or hydrogenated fat
the impression is sometimes given that all margarine is made by hydrogenation that simply not true
animal and vegetable fat and oil these are similar molecule differing in their melting point
if the compound is a solid at room temperature you usually call it a fat
if it is a liquid it is often described a an oil
their melting point are largely determined by the presence of double bond in the molecule
the higher the number of double bond the lower the melting point
if there are any double bond the substance is said to be saturated
a typical saturated fat might have the structure molecule of this sort are usually solid at room temperature
if there is only one double bond in each of the hydrocarbon chain it is called a fat or oil because it is likely to be a liquid at room temperature
a typical oil might be if there are two or more double bond in each chain then it is said to be polyunsaturated
for example for simplicity in all these diagram all three hydrocarbon chain in each molecule are the same
that doe have to be the case you can have a mixture of type of chain in the same molecule
making margarine vegetable oil often contain high proportion of polyunsaturated and fat oil and a a result are liquid at room temperature
that make them messy to spread on your bread or toast and inconvenient for some baking purpose
you can harden raise the melting point of the oil by hydrogenating it in the presence of a nickel catalyst
condition like the precise temperature or the length of time the hydrogen is passed through the oil are carefully controlled so that some but not necessarily all of the double bond are hydrogenated
this produce a partially hydrogenated oil or partially hydrogenated fat
you need to hydrogenate enough of the bond to give the final texture you want
however there are possible health benefit in eating or polyunsaturated fat or oil rather than saturated one so you would want to remove all the double bond
if you do a google search on this topic you will find all sort of conflicting information
look carefully at the reliability of the source of that information before you try to make up your mind
just because it is on the internet doe mean that it is right
the flow diagram below show the complete hydrogenation of a typical oil
the downside of hydrogenation a a mean of hardening fat and oil there are some probable health risk from eating hydrogenated fat or oil
consumer are becoming more aware of this and manufacturer are increasingly finding alternative way of converting oil into spreadable solid
one of the problem arises from the hydrogenation process
the double bond in unsaturated fat and oil tend to have the group around them arranged in the ci form
if you do understand what ci and trans isomer are you wo make any sense of what come next
on your browser to return to this page
the relatively high temperature used in the hydrogenation process tend to flip some of the double bond into the trans form
if these particular bond are hydrogenated during the process they will still be present in the final margarine in molecule of trans fat
the consumption of trans fat ha been shown to increase cholesterol level particularly of the more harmful ldl form leading to an increased risk of heart disease
any process which tends to increase the amount of trans fat in the diet is best avoided
read food label and avoid any food which contains or is cooked in hydrogenated oil or hydrogenated fat
i said earlier idea about this change all the time
it would be worth doing a google search on trans fatty acid
the u food and drug administration fda ha a useful fact sheet about them and the google search will find it for you amongst a lot of other information
