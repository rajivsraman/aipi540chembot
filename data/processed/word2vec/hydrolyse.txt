the mechanism for the acid catalysed hydrolysis of ester this page look in detail at the mechanism for the hydrolysis of ester in the presence of a dilute acid such a hydrochloric acid or sulphuric acid acting a the catalyst
it us ethyl ethanoate a a typical ester
the mechanism for the hydrolysis of ethyl ethanoate a reminder of the fact ethyl ethanoate is heated under reflux with a dilute acid such a dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulphuric acid
the ester reacts with the water present to produce ethanoic acid and ethanol
because the reaction is reversible an equilibrium mixture is produced containing all four of the substance in the equation
in order to get a much hydrolysis a possible a large excess of water can be used
the dilute acid provides both the acid catalyst and the water
the mechanism this is a fairly complex mechanism and is definitley not required for any uk a level or equivalent syllabus
i have included it in case it is of use to my many visitor
all the step in the mechanism below are shown a reaction because it make the mechanism look less confusing
the reverse reaction is actually done sufficiently differently that it affect the way the mechanism is written
you will find a link to the esterification reaction further down the page if you are interested
if you are happy about these follow this link before you go any further
to be honest if you are that unsure about the convention used in reaction mechanism you probably should be reading this page anyway you will find it distinctly scary

step 1 the actual catalyst in this case is the hydroxonium ion present in all solution of acid in water
in the first step the ester take a proton a hydrogen ion from the hydroxonium ion
the proton becomes attached to one of the lone pair on the oxygen which is to the carbon
the transfer of the proton to the oxygen give it a positive charge but the charge is actually delocalised spread around much more widely than this show
one way of representing this delocalisation is to draw a number of structure called resonance structure or canonical form joined by arrow
you could if you wished put in some curly arrow to show the movement of electron which change one of these structure into the next
none of these formula represents the true structure of the ion but each give you some information about it
for example notice where the positive charge is in the three structure
what this mean in reality is that the positive charge is spread around over those three atom the two oxygen and the carbon

it is important however that you do imagine that the molecule is rapidly flipping from one structure to another
the arrow mean something different
a mule is a hybrid of a donkey and a horse
in this notation you could represent a mule by writing donkey and horse connected by a arrow
neitherdonkey nor horse accurately represents what a mule look like but with a bit of imagination you could build up a fairly good picture of a mule by combining together the characteristic of both donkey and horse
but a mule obviously doe spend it time rapidly changing back and forth between being a donkey and a horse
the next stage of the mechanism involves an attack on the carbon and so it is convenient to use the structure showing the positive charge on that carbon in the next step
step 2 the positive charge on the carbon atom is attacked by one of the lone pair on the oxygen of a water molecule
on the other hand you could realise that there ha to be a positive charge somewhere because you started with one and that particular oxygen doe look right it ha too many bond
put the charge on there
that a quick reasoning which work every time i use it
step 3 what happens next is that a proton a hydrogen ion get transferred from the bottom oxygen atom to one of the others
it get picked off by one of the other substance in the mixture for example by attaching to a lone pair on a water molecule and then dumped back onto one of the oxygen more or less at random
eventually by chance it will join to the oxygen with the ethyl group attached
when that happens the net effect is step 4 now a molecule of ethanol is lost from the ion
that one of the product of the reaction
the structure for the latest ion is just like the one we discusssed at length back in step 1
the positive charge is actually delocalised all over that end of the ion
the real structure will be a hybrid of these it is easier to follow what is happening if we keep going with the structure with the charge on the carbon
step 5 the hydrogen is removed from the oxygen by reaction with a water molecule
and there we are
we have produced the ethanoic acid the other product of the reaction and the hydroxonium ion catalyst ha been regenerated
