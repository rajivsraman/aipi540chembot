hydrolysing nitrile this page look at the hydrolysis of nitrile under either acidic or alkaline condition to make carboxylic acid or their salt
the hydrolysis of nitrile introduction when nitrile are hydrolysed you can think of them reacting with water in two stage first to produce an amide and then the ammonium salt of a carboxylic acid
for example ethanenitrile would end up a ammonium ethanoate going via ethanamide
in practice the reaction between nitrile and water would be so slow a to be completely negligible
the nitrile is instead heated with either a dilute acid such a dilute hydrochloric acid or with an alkali such a sodium hydroxide solution
the end result is similar in all the case but the exact nature of the final product varies depending on the condition you use for the reaction
acidic hydrolysis of nitrile the nitrile is heated under reflux with dilute hydrochloric acid
instead of getting an ammonium salt a you would do if the reaction only involved water you produce the free carboxylic acid
for example with ethanenitrile and hydrochloric acid you would get ethanoic acid and ammonium chloride
why is the free acid formed rather than the ammonium salt
the ethanoate ion in the ammonium ethanoate react with hydrogen ion from the hydrochloric acid to produce ethanoic acid
ethanoic acid is only a weak acid and so once it ha got the hydrogen ion it tends to hang on to it
alkaline hydrolysis of nitrile the nitrile is heated under reflux with sodium hydroxide solution
this time instead of getting an ammonium salt a you would do if the reaction only involved water you get the sodium salt
ammonia gas is given off a well
for example with ethanenitrile and sodium hydroxide solution you would get sodium ethanoate and ammonia
the ammonia is formed from reaction between ammonium ion and hydroxide ion
if you wanted the free carboxylic acid in this case you would have to acidify the final solution with a strong acid such a dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulphuric acid
the ethanoate ion in the sodium ethanoate will react with hydrogen ion a mentioned above
