an industrial alkylation of benzene this page give you the fact and simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and alkene in the presence of a mixture of aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride a the catalyst
if you want these mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the process to produce ethylbenzene is currently asked for by the uk a level exam board aqa and i am including it solely to satisfy their requirement
if you do actually need to read this do
the fact industrially alkyl group can be substituted into a benzene ring using a variant on alkylation
one possibility is that instead of using a chloroalkane with an aluminium chloride catalyst they use an alkene and a mixture of aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride a the catalyst
this is a cheaper method because it save having to make the chloroalkane first
alkylation reaction before you go on
to put an ethyl group on the ring to make ethylbenzene benzene is treated with a mixture of ethene hcl and aluminium chloride
or better the aluminium chloride and hcl are written into these equation because they are acting a catalyst
if you wanted to include them you could write alcl3 and hcl over the top of the arrow
the formation of the electrophile the electrophile is
it is formed by reaction between the ethene and the hcl exactly a if you were beginning to add the hcl to the ethene
the chloride ion is immediately picked up by the aluminium chloride to form an ion
that prevents the chloride ion from reacting with the ion to form chloroethane
alkylation reaction to give the product you want anyway
the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two the hydrogen is removed by the ion which wa formed at the same time a the electrophile
the aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride catalyst are in this second stage
the fact the problem with more complicated alkene like propene is that you have to be careful about the structure of the product
in each case you can only really be sure of that structure if you work through the mechanism first
for example the propyl group becomes attached to the ring via it middle carbon atom and not it end one
you still need a mixture of aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride a catalyst
the formation of the electrophile when the propene reacts with the hcl the hydrogen becomes attached to the end carbon atom
a secondary carbocation carbonium ion is formed because it is more stable than the primary one which would have been formed if the addition wa the other way round
because the positive charge is on the centre carbon atom that is the one which will become attached to the ring
the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two again the hydrogen is removed by the ion
the aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride catalyst are in this second stage
