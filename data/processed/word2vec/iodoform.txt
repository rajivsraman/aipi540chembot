the triiodomethane iodoform reaction with aldehyde and ketone this page look at how the triiodomethane iodoform reaction can be used to identify the presence of a ch3co group in aldehyde and ketone
ch3ch oh group in alcohol
you will find a link to this at the bottom of the page
doing the triiodomethane iodoform reaction there are two apparently quite different mixture of reagent that can be used to do this reaction
they are in fact chemically equivalent
use whichever one your examiner want find out by looking at past paper and mark scheme

using iodine and sodium hydroxide solution this is chemically the more obvious method
iodine solution is added to a small amount of aldehyde or ketone followed by just enough sodium hydroxide solution to remove the colour of the iodine
if nothing happens in the cold it may be necessary to warm the mixture very gently
a positive result is the appearance of a very pale yellow precipitate of triiodomethane previously known a iodoform chi3
apart from it colour this can be recognised by it faintly medical smell
it is used a an antiseptic on the sort of sticky plaster you put on minor cut for example
using potassium iodide and sodium chlorate i solution sodium chlorate i is also known a sodium hypochlorite
potassium iodide solution is added to a small amount of aldehyde or ketone followed by sodium chlorate i solution
again if no precipitate is formed in the cold it may be necessary to warm the mixture very gently
the positive result is the same pale yellow precipitate a before
why the two reaction are equivalent the reaction happens in two stage first the aldehyde or ketone reacts with iodine and the product of that reaction reacts with hydroxide ion
that is obviously the mixture you are adding in the first method above
in the second method the sodium chlorate i solution is an oxidising agent and oxidises the iodide ion in the potassium iodide to iodine
a well a any possible precipitate you will also see the typical colour of iodine solution being formed during the reaction
so although you did put any iodine into the mixture it is made in situ
what about the hydroxide ion
sodium chlorate i solution is alkaline and contains enough hydroxide ion to carry out the second half of the reaction
the reason that sodium chlorate i is alkaline is that it reacts reversibly with water to form the weak acid chloric i acid together with hydroxide ion
the chemistry of the triiodomethane iodoform reaction what the triiodomethane iodoform reaction show a positive result the pale yellow precipitate of triiodomethane iodoform is given by an aldehyde or ketone containing the grouping r can be a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon group for example an alkyl group
if r is hydrogen then you have the aldehyde ethanal ch3cho
ethanal is the only aldehyde to give the triiodomethane iodoform reaction
if r is a hydrocarbon group then you have a ketone
lot of ketone give this reaction but those that do all have a methyl group on one side of the double bond
these are known a methyl ketone
equation for the triiodomethane iodoform reaction we will take the reagent a being iodine and sodium hydroxide solution
the first stage involves substitution of all three hydrogen in the methyl group by iodine atom
the presence of hydroxide ion is important for the reaction to happen they take part in the mechanism for the reaction not required for uk a level
in the second stage the bond between the c i3 and the rest of the molecule is broken to produce triiodomethane iodoform and the salt of an acid
putting all this together give the overall equation for the reaction
